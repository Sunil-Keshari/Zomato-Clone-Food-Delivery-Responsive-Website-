<h2> History </h2>
Early years (2015-2020)

Zomato logo in 2012
In 2015, Zomato started its food delivery service in India, initially partnering with companies such as Delhivery and Grab to fulfill deliveries from restaurants that did not have their own delivery service.

In January 2016, it launched Zomato Book's table reservation feature on its application in India.


<h2>Zomato's logo from 2016 to 2018 </h2>
In February 2017, it introduced a paid membership program called Zomato Gold using which subscribers could get offers and discounts on dining and food delivery at Zomato's partner restaurants.

In December 2018, Zomato launched its annual multi-city food and entertainment carnival called Zomaland.

In March 2019, Eternal Limited sold its UAE food delivery business to Talabat.

<h2> 2020 </h2>
In April 2020, due to a fall in food delivery and rising demand for online grocery ordering amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Zomato began delivering groceries and essentials under a service named Zomato Market in 80+ cities across India.[10] In April 2020, it introduced contactless dining at its partner restaurants.[11] In May 2020, Zomato also began delivering alcohol in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha after obtaining the permission of the governments in these states.

Zomato closed operations of Zomato Market in June 2020 as demand for food delivery recovered and grocery delivery business "was not scalable".[13] In April 2021, it pulled out of alcohol delivery service citing poor unit economics and scalability.

In April 2022, Zomato launched a pilot of 10-minute food delivery in Gurgaon called Zomato Instant.

In August 2022, Zomato launched a service called Intercity Legends in Delhi NCR that allowed users to have food delivered from famous restaurants in other cities within a few days.[16]

In June 2023, Zomato launched a feature that enabled users to build carts from up to four restaurants and place the order together.

<h2> Security breaches </h2>
On 4 June 2015, an Indian security researcher hacked the Zomato website and gained access to information about 62.5 million users. Using the vulnerability, he was able to access the personal data of users such as telephone numbers, email addresses, and Instagram private photos using their Instagram access token. Zomato fixed the issue within 48 hours of it becoming apparent.

On 18 May 2017, a security blog called HackRead claimed that over 17 million Zomato user records including emails and password hashes had been stolen due to a security breach. The company stated that no payment information or credit card details were stolen.[19] The hacker removed the stolen user data from the dark web after Zomato agreed to start a bug bounty program.

<h2> Feeding India </H2>
Started in 2014 by Ankit Kawatra, Feeding India is a nonprofit organisation which serves free meals to underprivileged people with the help of volunteers.[21] Feeding India was acquired by Zomato in July 2019.[22] In May 2022, Zomato claimed that Feeding India was serving over 200,000 meals every day under its Daily Feeding Program.

Zomato Feeding India has organised benefit concerts in Mumbai to raise awareness about malnutrition in India; it was headlined by Post Malone (in 2022)[24] and Dua Lipa (in 2024).
